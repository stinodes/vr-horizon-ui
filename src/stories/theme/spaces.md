## Spaces

The theme includes several consistent spacings you can use to space out your
rendered components. Manually adding margins and paddings to every rendered
element is a chore, and especially so to keep consistent.  
Therefore, as per [`styled-system`](https://styled-system.com/), you can pass indexes as
spacings. These will be resolved from the theme.

The included spaces are as follows:

```js
space: [0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256, 512]
```

These can be overwritten by declaring your own in your custom theme.
